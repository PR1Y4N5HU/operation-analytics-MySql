This project focuses on analyzing the database of a Microsoft Clone application, which contains valuable information about its consumers. By leveraging MySQL for data analysis and Excel for data visualization, we aim to gain insights into consumer behavior and extract valuable information that can drive decision-making and improve the app's performance.
To visualize the results and present them in a more accessible manner, we utilize Excel, a widely used tool for data visualization and analysis. By creating charts, graphs, and summary tables, we can effectively communicate the findings of our analysis, making it easier to interpret and draw actionable conclusions.
